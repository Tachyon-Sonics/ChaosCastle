		<p><b>Resulting Scalings</b></p>
		<p>
			The resulting scalings shown here are determined by the "<b>Quality</b>" and "<b>Size (% of screen)</b>" settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game uses a base resolution of 320x240. As most screens have a higher resolution, scaling is used. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Scaling is always and integer decomposed into two parts: <b>Inner Scaling</b> and <b>Outer Scaling</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Inner Scaling</b> uses vector graphics and high quality xBRZ scaling for a smooth result, but is slower. It is also limited to products of powers of 2, 3 and 5.</li>
			<li><b>Outer Scaling</b> always uses nearest-neighbour scaling (which results in "pixelated" graphics), but is faster.</li>
		</ul>
