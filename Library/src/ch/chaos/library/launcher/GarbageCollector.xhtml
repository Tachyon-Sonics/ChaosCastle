		<p><b>Garbage Collector</b></p>
		<p>
			Allows you to select the Java Garbage Collector to use.
		</p>
		<p>
			On 64-bit systems, you should always use the "ZGC", because it prevents any pause that may result in glitches during the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			The "ZGC" is not available on 32-bit systems, any may not be available on some Java Runtime Environments. In that case leave to "&lt; Default &gt;".
