		<p><b>Size (% of screen)</b></p>
		<p>
			Sometimes, the game does not achieve 60 FPS (smooth scrolling) even at the lowest quality. In that case, this setting can be used to make the game only use a fraction of the screen. The game's screen or window will be smaller, but scrolling will be smoother.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: the game's size is limited to integer multiples of 320x240. Hence it may be slightly slower than the screen even when 100% is chosen.
