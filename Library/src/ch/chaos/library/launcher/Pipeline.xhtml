		<p><b>Java2D Pipeline</b></p>
		<p>
			Allows you to select the 2D rendering pipeline to use.
		</p>
		<p>
			This setting currently has little effect because the game uses indexed (palette) colors, which is <i>not</i> hardware optimised. In fact, the game achieves smooth scrolling at 60 FPS even with the "Software" mode at a resolution of 1920x1080 and highest quality on modern laptops. This setting only affects the final on-screen rendering and the "Outer Scaling", if greater than 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few caveats:
			<ul>
				<li>The available pipelines differ between operating systems.</li>
				<li>"Default" is usually the safest one.</li>
				<li>Some pipelines ("Direct3D" on Windows, "OpenGL" on Linux) may have trouble rendering in-game menus and dialogs on hardware that is not fully compatible, especially in full-screen mode. Workaround is to pause the game, return to the main screen with [ALT]-[TAB] as necessary and then use the menu from the tray icon.</li>
			</ul>
