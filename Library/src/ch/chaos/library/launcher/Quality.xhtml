		<p><b>Quality</b></p>
		<p>
			The game has a base resolution of 320x240. This setting determines how to scale the graphics
			to the target resolution.
		</p>
		<p>
			High values mean that most of the scaling will use vector graphics and xBRZ for a smooth, but slower result. Low values mean that most of the scaling will use nearest-neighbour sacling (which results in "pixelated" graphics), but is faster.

			See information of the "<b>Resulting Scalings</b>" for more.
