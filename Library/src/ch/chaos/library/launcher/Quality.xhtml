		<p><b>Quality</b></p>
		<p>
			The game has a base resolution of 320 x 240. This setting determines how to scale the graphics
			to the target resolution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scaling is always and integer decomposed into two parts: <b>Inner Scaling</b> and <b>Outer Scaling</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Inner Scaling</b> uses vector graphics and high quality xBRZ scaling for a smooth result, but is slower.</li>
			<li><b>Outer Scaling</b> always uses nearest-neighbour scaling (which results in "pixelated" graphics), but is faster.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			High quality favors <b>Inner Scaling</b> whereas low quality favor <b>Outer Scaling</b>. The resulting
			<b>Inner Scaling</b> and <b>Outer Scaling</b> values are displayed below the "Quality" and "Size (% of screen)"
			settings.
