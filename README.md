# ChaosCastle

ChaosCastle is a simple, retro-like, 2D shoot-them-up game with a slow pace.

It starts with very simple levels. But as the game progress, the difficulty increases.

The game was initially released for the Amiga and Macintosh computers in 1999. This is a Java-port that runs on any modern hardware, and is very close to the original version (see **History** below).

Because this is an almost unmodified port of an old game, please read the instruction carefully (especially **Controls** and **Weapons**), because the game is far from having the conviviality and ease-of-use of your typical Smartphone game.
